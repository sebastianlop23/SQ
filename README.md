## Description

### Overview
This online tool allows users to enter, view, and analyze sleep data to reach conclusions on sleep management. This project wants to make accurate, useful descriptions of sleeping habits accessible to everyone.

### Method
In order to process and generate accurate conclusions for users, the app relies on user input. Such as:
* (HOS) Hours of sleep
* (MOD) Mood in which user woke up in
* (SNR) Snoring?
* (TIM) Time took to fall asleep
* (WOA) Amount of interruptions during sleep
Manual user input data allows for accurate interpretations on quality of sleep. Mood after sleep cannot be determined by sensors or cameras, but only our brain knows it. Some data like snoring, hours of sleep, and amount of interruptions during sleep can be predicted with current technologies; but for this approach, we'll use manual input.

### Algorithm
The basic logic behind this platform is solely driven by peer-reviewed research studies on the topic. Each user input is given a score (from 0 to 10) to determine the severity of the variable or the option selected for it. Each variable (examples listed above) is given a weight on the total quality score (detemined by research studies). Weights represent the variable's importance on determining quality of sleep. Currently the following are set:
```
* HOS = 10%
* MOD = 50%
* SNR = 5%
* TIM = 25%
* WOA = 10%
```
